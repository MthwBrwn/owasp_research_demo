# OWASP Research Demo

OWASP research demo

This demo is to demonstrate the OWASP vulnerability for injections.
This lab uses code from https://www.pythonforengineers.com/xkcd-style-sql-injection-hack-in-python/

This makes the command lines easier by packaging them into scripts for demonstrating in front of the 401 class
